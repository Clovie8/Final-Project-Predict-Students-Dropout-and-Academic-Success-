# Final-Project-Predict-Students-Dropout-and-Academic-Success-
This project aims to analyze various demographic, socio-economic, and academic factors to predict whether a student will graduate, drop out, or remain enrolled. By identifying at-risk students early, institutions can take proactive measures to improve retention rates and academic success.
